# Coursera Certificate Checker: Core Concepts

This document outlines the essential concepts underpinning the Coursera Certificate Checker project, structured by **Object**, the **Context** in which it operates, and the **Important Information** associated with that context. This can serve as a foundational overview for understanding the project's architecture and functionalities.

---

## 1. Object: Student

**Context:** A student logs in to verify their Coursera course completion and view/download certificates.

**Information:**
- **Student ID:** Unique identifier for each student.
- **Name:** Full name of the student.
- **Email:** Student's email address, used for login and communication.
- **Department:** The academic department the student belongs to.
- **Course(s) enrolled:** A list or reference to the Coursera courses the student is registered for or has completed.
- **Verified Certificates:** References to completed and successfully verified certificates belonging to the student.
- **Login Credentials:** Securely stored username/email and hashed password for system access.

## 2. Object: Faculty

**Context:** Faculty members validate student certificates, upload course lists, or assign courses.

**Information:**
- **Faculty ID:** Unique identifier for each faculty member.
- **Name:** Full name of the faculty member.
- **Department:** The academic department the faculty member belongs to.
- **Email:** Faculty's email address, used for login and communication.
- **Courses Offered:** A list or reference to courses they teach or are responsible for overseeing.
- **List of Verified Students:** A record of students whose certificates they have validated.
- **Admin Privileges:** A boolean flag indicating if the faculty member has elevated administrative access within the system.

## 3. Object: Course

**Context:** Represents a Coursera course that is available to students or assigned by faculty.

**Information:**
- **Course ID:** Unique identifier for each Coursera course.
- **Course Name:** The official title of the Coursera course.
- **Coursera Link:** The direct URL to the course page on the Coursera platform.
- **Department:** The college department associated with this specific Coursera course.
- **Duration:** The estimated time to complete the course (e.g., in weeks or hours).
- **Certificate Availability:** A boolean flag indicating whether a certificate is issued upon completion of this course.

---

## 4. Object: Certificate

**Context:** A digital certificate uploaded by a student or potentially fetched via a Coursera link/API for verification.

**Information:**
- **Certificate ID:** A unique identifier assigned to the certificate within the system.
- **File/URL:** The storage path to the uploaded certificate file (e.g., PDF) or its direct URL on Coursera.
- **Issued Date:** The date the certificate was officially issued by Coursera.
- **Course ID (Foreign Key):** A reference linking this certificate to the corresponding Course object.
- **Student ID (Foreign Key):** A reference linking this certificate to the Student who earned it.
- **Status:** The current verification status of the certificate, typically one of: Verified, Pending, or Rejected.

## 5. Object: Admin Panel

**Context:** Used by authorized faculty or dedicated administrators to manage system-wide actions, including CRUD operations and verification workflows.

**Information:**
- **User Management:** Functionality to add, edit, delete, and manage both Student and Faculty accounts.
- **Course Management:** Tools to add, remove, and modify Course records available in the system.
- **Certificate Verification Dashboard:** A centralized interface to review, process, and manage all submitted certificate verification requests.
- **Search & Filter Tools:** Capabilities to efficiently locate specific users, certificates, or courses based on various criteria.
- **Reports or Logs:** Access to system activity, historical verification data, and error logs for auditing and monitoring.

---

## 6. Object: Authentication System

**Context:** Handles user login, registration, and access control, ensuring secure and role-appropriate interaction with the application.

**Information:**
- **Role-based Access:** The logic that defines and enforces permissions based on user roles (Student, Faculty, Admin).
- **Login Logs:** Records of all login attempts, including success/failure status, timestamps, and user details for security auditing.
- **Session Details:** Information about active user sessions, managing their state and duration.
- **Password Hashing:** The secure cryptographic method used to store user passwords, preventing plain-text exposure.
- **OTP Mechanism:** For secure password recovery or two-factor authentication.

---

## 7. Object: Database

**Context:** The backend system responsible for persistent storage and retrieval of all application data.

**Information:**
- **Tables:** The primary data structures, including:
  - Students
  - Faculty
  - Courses
  - Certificates
  - Admin (or specific admin roles integrated within the Faculty table)
- **Relationships:** Defines how different tables are interconnected (e.g., Student ↔ Certificate ↔ Course ↔ Faculty), often through foreign keys.
- **Foreign Key Constraints:** Rules implemented at the database level to maintain data integrity and consistency across related tables.
- **CRUD Operations:** The fundamental operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) supported for all data entities within the database.

---

## 8. Object: Verification

**Context:** The core intelligence that checks the validity and authenticity of certificate details, either through manual review by faculty or automated processes.

**Information:**
- **Certificate URL or File Parsing:** The method or algorithm used to extract relevant data (e.g., student name, course name, completion date, certificate ID) from the uploaded certificate file or a Coursera URL.
- **Matching Student Details:** Logic to compare the student's name on the certificate with the name registered in the system's Student records.
- **Matching Course Name/Date:** Logic to confirm that the course name and completion date on the certificate align with the expected Course information stored in the database.
- **Valid/Invalid Flag:** The conclusive outcome of the verification process, indicating whether the certificate is deemed authentic and correct.

---

## 9. Object: User Interface

**Context:** The front-end web interface (developed using JSP) that enables users to interact with the application.

**Information:**
- **Login/Signup Forms:** Dedicated web pages for user authentication and new user registration.
- **Dashboard Views:** Personalized landing pages that display relevant information and quick access options for both students and faculty.
- **Upload/Download Certificate Modules:** Specific UI components allowing students to submit their certificates and users to download verified ones.
- **Status Display:** Visual elements (e.g., text, icons, color-coding) that clearly communicate the current verification status of submitted certificates (Success, Failure, Pending).
